## 1. Classical Reversal Patterns

### Head and Shoulders (Top)
- **Structure**: Three peaks — left shoulder, head (highest), right shoulder. Neckline connects the two troughs.
- **Volume**: Typically heaviest on left shoulder, lighter on head, lightest on right shoulder. Expands on neckline break.
- **Confirmation**: Close below neckline on expanding volume.
- **Measured move**: Distance from head to neckline, projected down from neckline break.
- **Failure**: Price breaks above right shoulder after neckline violation → strong bullish signal (failed H&S).
- **Psychology**: Bulls push to new high (head) but can't sustain it. The failure to match the head on the right shoulder reveals exhaustion.
- **Reliability**: One of the most reliable reversal patterns when volume confirms.

### Inverse Head and Shoulders (Bottom)
- **Structure**: Three troughs — left shoulder, head (lowest), right shoulder. Neckline connects the two peaks.
- **Volume**: Should expand on breakout above neckline. Volume on head ideally lighter than left shoulder.
- **Measured move**: Head-to-neckline distance projected up from breakout.
- **Notes**: Neckline can slope — upward-sloping neckline is more bullish. Pullback to neckline that holds = confirmation.

### Double Top
- **Structure**: Two peaks at approximately the same price. Trough between them = neckline.
- **Volume**: Second peak typically on lighter volume than first.
- **Confirmation**: Break below the intervening trough.
- **Measured move**: Height of pattern (peaks to trough) projected down from break.
- **Common mistake**: Calling a double top before the neckline breaks. Two touches of resistance is NOT a double top until the support between them fails.

### Double Bottom
- **Structure**: Two troughs at approximately the same price. Peak between them = neckline.
- **Volume**: Typically expands on second bottom and on breakout.
- **Measured move**: Height of pattern projected up from breakout.
- **Notes**: Second bottom slightly above first is actually MORE bullish (demonstrates increasing demand).

### Triple Top / Triple Bottom
- **Structure**: Three peaks/troughs at approximately equal levels.
- **Volume**: Progressively declining volume on each test of resistance/support.
- **Confirmation**: Break of the support/resistance connecting the intervening troughs/peaks.
- **Notes**: Less common than double patterns. The more tests of a level, the more significant the eventual break.

### Rounding Top (Saucer Top) / Rounding Bottom (Saucer Bottom)
- **Structure**: Gradual, curved transition from trend to reversal. No sharp breakout point.
- **Volume**: Forms a matching curved pattern — heaviest at the extremes, lightest at the inflection point.
- **Notes**: Often takes a long time to complete. Difficult to trade with precise entries. Best used as a directional context signal.

## 2. Classical Continuation Patterns

### Flag
- **Structure**: Small parallelogram that slopes against the prevailing trend. Forms after a sharp, near-vertical move (the "pole").
- **Volume**: Declines during flag formation, expands on breakout in trend direction.
- **Duration**: Typically 1-3 weeks. Longer = less reliable.
- **Measured move**: Length of the flagpole projected from breakout point.
- **Location**: Often appears at the approximate midpoint of the move (half-mast pattern).

### Pennant
- **Structure**: Small symmetrical triangle following a sharp move. Like a flag but converging rather than parallel.
- **Volume**: Same as flag — declines during formation, expands on breakout.
- **Measured move**: Flagpole projection.
- **Notes**: Pennant vs. flag is aesthetic — the trading implications are identical.

### Symmetrical Triangle
- **Structure**: Converging trendlines with lower highs and higher lows. Neither side controls.
- **Volume**: Progressively declines within the triangle.
- **Breakout**: Can break either direction. Direction of break is the signal. Breakout typically occurs between 50-75% of the way through the triangle.
- **Measured move**: Widest part of triangle projected from breakout.
- **Failure**: Late breaks (past 75% of triangle) are less reliable.

### Ascending Triangle
- **Structure**: Flat upper boundary (resistance) with rising lower trendline (higher lows).
- **Bias**: Bullish — buyers becoming more aggressive, willing to buy at higher prices.
- **Breakout**: Typically upward through flat resistance.
- **Measured move**: Height of triangle projected up from breakout.

### Descending Triangle
- **Structure**: Flat lower boundary (support) with declining upper trendline (lower highs).
- **Bias**: Bearish — sellers becoming more aggressive, willing to sell at lower prices.
- **Breakout**: Typically downward through flat support.
- **Measured move**: Height of triangle projected down from break.

### Rectangle (Trading Range)
- **Structure**: Horizontal support and resistance containing price. Price bounces between boundaries.
- **Volume**: Often declines within range. Expanding on breakout.
- **Breakout**: Can break either direction. Direction of break determines signal.
- **Trading**: Can trade both sides of the range until breakout occurs.
- **Measured move**: Height of rectangle projected from breakout.

### Rising Wedge (Bearish)
- **Structure**: Converging trendlines both sloping upward. Narrowing range within an uptrend.
- **Implication**: Bearish — momentum fading despite higher prices. Demand weakening.
- **Breakout**: Typically breaks downward.
- **Notes**: Often occurs in the final stages of an uptrend.

### Falling Wedge (Bullish)
- **Structure**: Converging trendlines both sloping downward. Narrowing range within a downtrend.
- **Implication**: Bullish — selling pressure diminishing. Supply drying up.
- **Breakout**: Typically breaks upward.

## 3. Gap Types

### Common Gap
- Occurs within a trading range or congestion area
- Low significance — often filled quickly
- Typically on average or below-average volume
- Do not trade based on common gaps alone

### Breakaway Gap
- Occurs at the beginning of a new trend, breaking out of a pattern or range
- High significance — marks the start of a directional move
- Typically on high volume
- Usually NOT filled quickly (if filled, the breakout may be failing)
- Trading implication: Strong entry signal in direction of gap

### Runaway (Measuring) Gap
- Occurs in the middle of a strong trend
- Represents trend acceleration — price "runs away" from participants
- Can be used to estimate remaining move: distance from trend start to gap = approximate distance remaining
- Moderate to high volume
- Usually not filled until the trend ends

### Exhaustion Gap
- Occurs near the end of a trend
- Represents final burst of activity before reversal
- Often filled within a few days
- When a gap is filled after a strong trend, it's likely an exhaustion gap
- Island reversal: Exhaustion gap followed by breakaway gap in opposite direction = strong reversal signal

## 4. Candlestick Patterns

### Single-Candle Patterns

**Doji**: Open ≈ close. Shadows can vary. Represents indecision.
- Long-legged doji: Long upper and lower shadows. Maximum indecision.
- Gravestone doji: No lower shadow, long upper shadow. Bearish at tops.
- Dragonfly doji: No upper shadow, long lower shadow. Bullish at bottoms.
- Four-price doji: Open = high = low = close. Extremely rare.
- Significance amplified after strong trends.

**Hammer**: Small real body at top of range, long lower shadow (≥2x body), minimal upper shadow.
- Location: Bottom of downtrend.
- Implication: Bullish — sellers pushed price down but buyers recovered.
- Confirmation: Following bullish candle.
- Shadow: Lower shadow should be at least 2x the real body.

**Hanging Man**: Identical shape to hammer.
- Location: Top of uptrend.
- Implication: Bearish warning — buying occurred but selling interest appeared.
- Confirmation: Following bearish candle needed (less reliable without it).

**Shooting Star**: Small body at bottom of range, long upper shadow, minimal lower shadow.
- Location: Top of uptrend.
- Implication: Bearish — buyers pushed price up but sellers took control.

**Inverted Hammer**: Small body at bottom of range, long upper shadow.
- Location: Bottom of downtrend.
- Implication: Potential bullish reversal. Requires confirmation.

**Marubozu**: Full body, no shadows (or negligible).
- Bullish marubozu: Open = low, close = high. Strong buying.
- Bearish marubozu: Open = high, close = low. Strong selling.
- Represents conviction and strong directional control.

**Spinning Top**: Small real body, upper and lower shadows present.
- Represents indecision, like a doji but with a small body.
- Less significant than doji.

### Multi-Candle Reversal Patterns

**Bullish Engulfing**: Bearish candle followed by larger bullish candle that completely engulfs prior body.
- Location: Bottom of downtrend.
- Volume should be higher on the engulfing candle.
- The more the second candle exceeds the first, the stronger the signal.

**Bearish Engulfing**: Bullish candle followed by larger bearish candle that completely engulfs prior body.
- Location: Top of uptrend.
- Same volume principle applies.

**Harami (Bullish)**: Large bearish candle followed by small bullish candle contained within prior body.
- Location: Bottom of downtrend.
- Opposite of engulfing — the second candle is INSIDE the first.
- Less powerful than engulfing but still significant.

**Harami (Bearish)**: Large bullish candle followed by small bearish candle within prior body.
- Location: Top of uptrend.

**Morning Star**: Three-candle bullish reversal.
1. Large bearish candle (establishes downtrend)
2. Small body candle or doji (indecision — gap down)
3. Large bullish candle that closes well into the first candle's body
- Gap between candles 1-2 and 2-3 strengthens the pattern.

**Evening Star**: Three-candle bearish reversal.
1. Large bullish candle
2. Small body or doji (gap up)
3. Large bearish candle closing well into the first candle's body

**Piercing Pattern**: Two-candle bullish reversal.
1. Bearish candle
2. Bullish candle that opens below prior low but closes above midpoint of prior body
- Must penetrate at least 50% of prior body to be valid.

**Dark Cloud Cover**: Two-candle bearish reversal.
1. Bullish candle
2. Bearish candle that opens above prior high but closes below midpoint of prior body

**Tweezer Top/Bottom**: Two candles with matching highs (top) or matching lows (bottom).
- Less common, moderate reliability.
- Works best at established S/R levels.

### Candlestick Interpretation Rules
1. Always consider CONTEXT: A hammer in a downtrend is meaningful. A hammer in an uptrend is not.
2. Confirmation required: Most candle patterns need follow-through from the next candle.
3. Candles at S/R: Patterns occurring at significant S/R levels carry more weight.
4. Volume: Higher volume on the signal candle increases reliability.
5. Candles are not standalone: Use with other TA tools (trend, S/R, indicators) for best results.
6. Strength hierarchy (reversal): Engulfing > Morning/Evening Star > Piercing/Dark Cloud > Harami > Doji

## 5. Point-and-Figure Patterns

### Construction Basics
- X = rising prices (demand) | O = falling prices (supply)
- Box size: Price increment per X or O
- Reversal: Number of boxes in opposite direction needed to start new column
- Standard: 3-box reversal
- Larger box/reversal = smoother, fewer signals | Smaller = more sensitive, more noise

### P&F Buy Signals
- **Double Top**: Column of X exceeds prior column of X. Simplest buy signal.
- **Triple Top**: Exceeds two prior X columns. Stronger signal.
- **Ascending Triple Top**: Each X column higher than the previous. Bullish trend pattern.
- **Catapult (Bullish)**: Triple top breakout followed by brief pullback, then another double top breakout. Very strong.

### P&F Sell Signals
- **Double Bottom**: Column of O exceeds prior column of O (breaks below).
- **Triple Bottom**: Exceeds two prior O columns.
- **Descending Triple Bottom**: Each O column lower than previous.
- **Catapult (Bearish)**: Triple bottom breakdown followed by brief rally, then another double bottom breakdown.

### P&F Price Targets
- **Horizontal Count**: Count the number of columns in the pattern × box size × reversal amount. Add to (buy) or subtract from (sell) the pattern base.
- **Vertical Count**: Height of breakout column × box size × reversal. Add to low of breakout column (buy) or subtract from high (sell).
- Horizontal count is more conservative. Vertical count gives a more aggressive target.

### P&F Trendlines
- Bullish support line: 45-degree line drawn upward from lowest O
- Bearish resistance line: 45-degree line drawn downward from highest X
- Price above bullish support line = bullish posture
- Price below bearish resistance line = bearish posture
