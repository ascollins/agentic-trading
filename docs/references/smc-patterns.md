# Smart Money Concepts — Quick Reference

## Market Structure

### Bullish Structure
- Higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL)
- BOS confirmed when price breaks above previous swing high
- Pullbacks into demand zones / bullish OBs are entry opportunities

### Bearish Structure  
- Lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL)
- BOS confirmed when price breaks below previous swing low
- Rallies into supply zones / bearish OBs are entry opportunities

### Change of Character (CHoCH)
- First sign of potential trend reversal
- Bullish CHoCH: price breaks above a lower high in a downtrend
- Bearish CHoCH: price breaks below a higher low in an uptrend
- CHoCH alone is not confirmation — requires follow-through BOS

## Order Blocks

### Bullish Order Block
- Last bearish candle before a strong bullish impulse that breaks structure
- Price returns to this zone for potential long entry
- Higher probability when: aligns with HTF demand, has FVG nearby, sits in discount zone

### Bearish Order Block
- Last bullish candle before a strong bearish impulse that breaks structure
- Price returns to this zone for potential short entry
- Higher probability when: aligns with HTF supply, has FVG nearby, sits in premium zone

### Order Block Validity
- Unmitigated: price has not returned to the OB yet (highest probability)
- Partially mitigated: price wicked into OB but didn't close through it
- Fully mitigated: price closed through the OB (invalidated, no longer valid)

## Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)

### Definition
- Three-candle pattern where candle 1's high and candle 3's low don't overlap (bullish FVG)
- Or candle 1's low and candle 3's high don't overlap (bearish FVG)
- Represents imbalance / inefficiency in price delivery

### Trading FVGs
- Price tends to return to fill FVGs before continuing
- Consequent encroachment (CE): the 50% level of the FVG — key reaction point
- Breakaway gaps: FVGs that DON'T fill, typically in strong trend moves

## Liquidity Concepts

### Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL)
- Stop losses of short sellers sitting above swing highs
- Institutional target for liquidity grabs before reversals lower
- "Sweep and reverse" pattern: price spikes above highs then reverses sharply

### Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL)
- Stop losses of long holders sitting below swing lows
- Institutional target for liquidity grabs before reversals higher
- Equal lows are particularly strong liquidity targets

### Liquidity Sweep Confirmation
- A sweep is only tradeable if it's followed by:
  1. Immediate reversal candle (engulfing, pin bar)
  2. Reclaim of the level that was swept
  3. Shift in lower-timeframe structure (CHoCH on 15m/1H)

## Premium / Discount Model

### Dealing Range
- Defined by the most recent significant swing high and swing low
- 50% level (equilibrium) divides premium from discount

### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)
- 0.618 - 0.786 Fibonacci retracement of the dealing range
- Longs in OTE of discount zone (below equilibrium)
- Shorts in OTE of premium zone (above equilibrium)

## Wyckoff Market Phases

### Accumulation (Buying Phase)
1. Preliminary Support (PS): first buying after extended decline
2. Selling Climax (SC): panic selling, sharp drop, high volume
3. Automatic Rally (AR): bounces off SC, defines range top
4. Secondary Test (ST): re-tests SC area on lower volume
5. Spring: false break below range, shakes out weak hands
6. Sign of Strength (SOS): strong move above range resistance
7. Last Point of Support (LPS): pullback to range, entry point

### Distribution (Selling Phase)
1. Preliminary Supply (PSY): first selling after extended advance
2. Buying Climax (BC): euphoric buying, sharp spike, high volume
3. Automatic Reaction (AR): sells off from BC, defines range bottom
4. Secondary Test (ST): re-tests BC area on lower volume
5. Upthrust (UT): false break above range, traps late buyers
6. Sign of Weakness (SOW): strong move below range support
7. Last Point of Supply (LPSY): weak rally to range, short entry

## Crypto-Specific Considerations

### Funding Rate Signals
- Extreme positive funding (>0.05%/8h): longs are crowded, short squeeze less likely, long squeeze more likely
- Extreme negative funding (<-0.03%/8h): shorts are crowded, short squeeze likely
- Neutral funding with rising price: healthiest uptrend signal

### Open Interest Dynamics
- Rising OI + rising price = new longs entering (bullish if trend-aligned)
- Rising OI + falling price = new shorts entering (bearish if trend-aligned)
- Falling OI + rising price = short covering rally (weaker, may fade)
- Falling OI + falling price = long capitulation (watch for exhaustion)

### Token Unlock Impact
- Large unlocks (>2% of circulating supply): typically bearish short-term
- Market often front-runs unlocks — selling starts 1-2 weeks before
- Post-unlock recovery is common if fundamentals are intact

### BTC Dominance Regimes
- Rising BTC.D + rising BTC: risk-off within crypto, BTC-only rally
- Rising BTC.D + falling BTC: full risk-off, alts getting destroyed
- Falling BTC.D + rising BTC: alt season signal, risk-on
- Falling BTC.D + falling BTC: stablecoin rotation, market fear
