# Intermarket & Macro Analysis — Crypto Context Reference

Crypto does not trade in a vacuum. This reference covers the macro relationships, cross-asset
correlations, and economic signals that influence crypto price action. Grounded in CMT L1
comparative market analysis, L2 cross-asset analysis, and L3 portfolio integration concepts.

## 1. Key Macro Drivers for Digital Assets (CMT L3)

### US Dollar Index (DXY)
- **Inverse correlation**: BTC and crypto broadly have a negative correlation with DXY
- Strong DXY (dollar strengthening) = headwind for crypto. Tightens global liquidity.
- Weak DXY (dollar weakening) = tailwind. Loose dollar conditions = risk-on.
- **Key levels**: DXY above 105 = material headwind. DXY below 100 = supportive environment.
- **Trading use**: DXY trend change often leads crypto trend change by days/weeks. Monitor DXY weekly chart for structure breaks.

### Federal Reserve Policy & Interest Rates
- **Fed Funds Rate**: Higher rates = tighter financial conditions = negative for risk assets including crypto
- **Rate cut expectations**: Crypto rallies tend to begin when market starts pricing in cuts, not when cuts actually happen
- **Real rates** (nominal rate minus inflation): Rising real rates = worst environment for crypto. Falling real rates = best environment.
- **Fed balance sheet**: Expansion (QE) = positive for crypto. Contraction (QT) = headwind. Track monthly.
- **CME FedWatch Tool**: Probability of rate changes. Shifts in expectations move markets before actual decisions.

### Global Liquidity
- **Net global liquidity**: Central bank balance sheets (Fed + ECB + BOJ + PBOC) minus reverse repo / Treasury General Account
- Rising global liquidity = rising crypto (strongest macro correlation for BTC)
- BTC often tracks global liquidity with a ~3-month lag
- **M2 money supply**: Global M2 expansion correlates with BTC multi-year moves
- **Trading use**: When liquidity is expanding, be long crypto with wider stops. When contracting, reduce exposure and tighten risk.

### Currency Debasement (CMT L3)
- Bitcoin's narrative as "digital gold" / inflation hedge strengthens during currency debasement concerns
- Sovereign debt crises, fiscal expansion, yield curve control → increased BTC demand
- Track: US debt-to-GDP, fiscal deficit trajectory, gold price (proxy for debasement concern)

### Economic Cycles (CMT L3)
- **Early expansion**: Risk appetite returns. Crypto typically rallies hard (post-recession recovery).
- **Mid expansion**: Strongest environment. Growth + moderate policy = best risk-reward for crypto.
- **Late expansion**: Crypto can still rally but with increasing fragility. Watch for yield curve inversion.
- **Contraction**: Crypto sells off with risk assets initially. BTC may decouple faster than alts due to "digital gold" bid.
- **ISM Manufacturing**: Below 50 = contraction. Transition from below 50 to above 50 historically coincides with crypto rallies.

## 2. Cross-Asset Correlations

### BTC ↔ S&P 500 / Nasdaq
- **Regime-dependent correlation** (CMT L3):
  - In risk-off events: Correlation spikes to 0.6-0.8 (BTC trades like a high-beta tech stock)
  - In normal markets: Correlation 0.3-0.5 (moderate positive)
  - In crypto-specific events: Correlation drops toward 0 (idiosyncratic moves)
- SPX/NDQ making new highs = supportive for crypto
- SPX/NDQ breaking down = warning for crypto positions (reduce exposure)
- **Lead/lag**: Sometimes equity weakness precedes crypto weakness by 1-3 days. Sometimes crypto leads (as in March 2020 and Nov 2022).

### BTC ↔ Gold
- Historically low correlation (0.0-0.2) over most periods
- Correlation increases during currency debasement fears / macro uncertainty
- Both respond to real rate declines and dollar weakness, but with different timing
- Gold tends to lead during uncertainty; BTC amplifies the move
- **When both BTC and gold rally simultaneously**: Strong macro signal for hard asset bid

### BTC ↔ Bonds / Yields
- **10-Year Treasury Yield**: Rising yields (falling bond prices) = headwind for crypto in tightening cycles
- **2Y-10Y yield curve**: Inversion = recession signal. Crypto typically sells off during inversions. Re-steepening (curve normalising) often precedes crypto recovery.
- **TLT (Long-term Treasury ETF)**: Sustained TLT rally (yields falling) = risk-on environment developing
- **Credit spreads** (HY OAS): Widening spreads = risk aversion increasing. Narrowing = risk appetite. Crypto correlates with tight credit conditions.

### BTC ↔ Oil / Commodities
- Low direct correlation, but oil spikes can signal inflation resurgence → affects Fed policy → affects crypto
- CRB Commodity Index trend direction provides macro inflation context
- Commodity supercycle thesis: if commodities in secular uptrend, benefits the "real assets" narrative for crypto

### Crypto Internal Correlations (BTC Dominance)
See `references/smc-patterns.md` for BTC dominance regime interpretation.
- BTC.D rising + BTC rising = risk-off within crypto (BTC only rally)
- BTC.D falling + BTC rising = risk-on, alt season developing
- BTC.D rising + BTC falling = full risk-off, alts getting destroyed (worst scenario for altcoins)
- BTC.D falling + BTC falling = stablecoin rotation, fear

### ETH/BTC Ratio
- **Key barometer for alt season**: ETH/BTC uptrend = capital rotating into alts (ETH is the "gateway alt")
- ETH/BTC downtrend = BTC dominance, stay overweight BTC
- ETH/BTC breaking key support = warning to reduce alt exposure
- Historical cycle pattern: ETH/BTC bottoms after BTC peaks, indicating capital rotation sequencing

## 4. Event Calendar — Crypto-Specific Catalysts

### Recurring Events
- **FOMC meetings**: 8x per year. Rate decisions + dot plot (quarterly) + press conference. Pre-FOMC volatility compression → post-decision expansion.
- **CPI release**: Monthly. Hotter than expected = bearish (rates stay higher). Cooler = bullish.
- **Options expiry**: Deribit quarterly expiries (end March/June/Sept/Dec) — significant for max pain dynamics. Weekly expiries (Fridays) for short-term.
- **Futures expiry**: CME BTC/ETH monthly expiry can create temporary price distortion.

### Crypto-Native Events
- **Bitcoin halvings**: ~Every 4 years (next: ~2028). Reduces new BTC issuance by 50%. Historically bullish 12-18 months post-halving.
- **Ethereum upgrades**: Protocol upgrades (Pectra, etc.) can affect supply dynamics and network capacity.
- **Token unlocks**: Track via TokenUnlocks.app. Large unlocks (>2% circulating supply) = potential selling pressure. Market often front-runs 1-2 weeks before.
- **ETF flow data**: For spot BTC/ETH ETFs, daily flow data = direct demand/supply signal. Sustained inflows = bullish. Outflows = bearish.
- **Regulatory decisions**: SEC actions, CFTC guidance, MiCA enforcement (EU), stablecoin regulation — binary risk events.
- **Exchange events**: Exchange hacks, proof-of-reserves issues, delistings — can trigger market-wide risk-off.

## 5. Regime Framework — Integrating Macro into Crypto Positioning

### Regime 1: Risk-On (Bullish Crypto Environment)
**Conditions**: DXY falling, rates falling or expected to fall, equities rising, VIX low/falling, credit spreads tight, global liquidity expanding
**Crypto approach**: Full position sizing, favour higher-beta alts, wider trailing stops, trend-follow aggressively

### Regime 2: Risk-Off (Bearish Crypto Environment)
**Conditions**: DXY rising, rates rising, equities falling, VIX spiking, credit spreads widening, liquidity contracting
**Crypto approach**: Reduced position sizing (50% or less of normal), BTC-heavy or stablecoin, tight stops, counter-trend only at major support with 3:1+ R:R

### Regime 3: Transition (Inflection Points)
**Conditions**: Mixed signals — e.g., DXY turning but rates still elevated, or equities basing but VIX still elevated
**Crypto approach**: Smallest position sizes, probe positions only, scale in gradually as confirmation develops. These periods offer the best R:R but lowest certainty.

### Regime 4: Crypto-Specific (Decoupled)
**Conditions**: Crypto moving independently of macro (exchange collapse, regulatory event, major hack, supply shock)
**Crypto approach**: Macro framework takes backseat. Focus purely on crypto-native analysis: on-chain flows, exchange health, sentiment, and technical levels. These events create the sharpest dislocations — both for loss and opportunity.

## 6. Practical Integration

When presenting analysis, state the macro regime before the trade thesis:

```
MACRO CONTEXT:
- DXY: [Trending up/down/ranging] at [level]
- Rates: [Tightening/easing/pause]
- Equities: [Risk-on/off/transitioning]
- Liquidity: [Expanding/contracting]
- Regime: [1-4 from above]
- Macro alignment with trade: [Supportive / Headwind / Neutral]
```

If macro is a headwind but TA setup is compelling, reduce conviction and position size. If macro aligns with TA, increase conviction. Macro context doesn't override TA timing but frames the risk envelope.
